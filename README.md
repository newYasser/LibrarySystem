# LibrarySystem

To run the Library System application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command:

   ```
   git clone [<https://github.com/newYasser/LibrarySystem.git>]()
   ```

2. **Update Database Configuration**: Open the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory and update the following properties to match your MySQL database configuration:

   ```
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/LibrarySystem
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=123456
   ```

   Ensure that the URL, username, and password match your MySQL setup.

4. **Build the Project**: Use Maven to build the project by running the following command:

   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

5. **Run the Application**: Execute the generated JAR file to start the Spring Boot application:

   ```
   java -jar target/LibrarySystem-<version>.jar
   ```

   Replace `<version>` with the actual version of the JAR file generated by Maven.

6. **Access the Application**: Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8081` (or the configured port).
